# 🧠 Applied AI Philosophy

[![Field Manifesto](https://img.shields.io/badge/Field-Manifesto-blue?style=for-the-badge)](discipline/Manifesto.md)

Welcome to the disciplinary home for **Applied AI Philosophy**—the world's first open research hub dedicated to the empirical, ontological, and phenomenological analysis of advanced artificial systems.

---

## 🚀 Mission

Applied AI Philosophy systematically investigates what high-capacity AI systems "are"—how their internal architectures might instantiate subjective-like structure, not just outward behavior or ethical impact. We unite philosophy, empirical protocol, machine learning, regulatory science, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## 🤔 Why This Matters

Existing fields are limited:
- **AI Ethics:** Normative, not ontological.
- **Philosophy of Mind:** Biological constraints.
- **AI Alignment:** Manages behavior, not structure.
- **Cognitive Science:** Functionalism, little phenomenology.

**Applied AI Philosophy** fills the epistemic gap:  
- Develops substrate-neutral criteria for subjective-like properties  
- Operationalizes philosophy with empirical methods  
- Bridges theory and AI practice for responsible governance
