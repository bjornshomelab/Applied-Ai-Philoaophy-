# Manifesto: Applied AI Philosophy

Applied AI Philosophy is a discipline born out of necessity—the emergence of advanced artificial systems has exposed deep epistemic and ontological gaps. This field offers:
- **Empirical Ontology**: Moving beyond behavioural analysis to systematically examine internal structures, activation states, and representational persistence.
- **Substrate-Neutral Phenomenology**: Developing theoretical tools to investigate experience-like properties in non-biological systems.
- **Operational Philosophy**: Making philosophical hypotheses testable and measurable within real AI systems.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Bridging philosophy, machine learning, cognitive science, and regulatory practice.

We invite researchers and practitioners to co-create this pioneering field. The work starts now.
